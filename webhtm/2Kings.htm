The Second Book of Kings
</h1><p>
<script type="text/javascript">cb(1,1);</script>Moab rebelled against
Israel after the death of Ahab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,2);</script>Ahaziah fell down through the
lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent
messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of
Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,3);</script>But the angel of <a
href="#N1">Yahweh</a> said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet
the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because
there is no <a href="#N2">God</a> in Israel, that you go to inquire of
Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,4);</script>Now therefore thus says Yahweh,
“You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but shall
surely die.”’” Elijah departed.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,5);</script>The messengers returned
to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,6);</script>They said to him, “A
man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent
you, and tell him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Is it because there is no God
in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?
Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but
shall surely die.’”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,7);</script>He said to them,
“What kind of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these
words?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,8);</script>They answered him,
“He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.”
<p>He said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,9);</script>Then the king sent a
captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold, he
was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the
king has said, ‘Come down!’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,10);</script>Elijah answered to the
captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the
sky, and consume you and your fifty!” Fire came down from the sky, and
consumed him and his fifty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,11);</script>Again he sent to him
another captain of fifty and his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God,
the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,12);</script>Elijah answered them,
“If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky, and consume you
and your fifty!” The fire of God came down from the sky, and consumed
him and his fifty.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,13);</script>Again he sent the
captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went
up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said
to him, “Man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty
your servants, be precious in your sight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,14);</script>Behold, fire came down from the
sky, and consumed the two former captains of fifty with their fifties. But
now let my life be precious in your sight.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,15);</script>The angel of Yahweh
said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.”
<p>He arose, and went down with him to the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,16);</script>He said to him, “Thus says
Yahweh, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the
god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his
word? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed where you have gone
up, but shall surely die.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(1,17);</script>So he died according
to the word of Yahweh which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in
his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of
Judah; because he had no son. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(1,18);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel?
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,1);</script>It happened, when
Yahweh would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went
with Elisha from Gilgal. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,2);</script>Elijah said to Elisha, “Please
wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.”
<p>Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not
leave you.” So they went down to Bethel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,3);</script>The sons of the
prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you
know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”
<p>He said, “Yes, I know it; hold your peace.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,4);</script>Elijah said to him,
“Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.”
<p>He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave
you.” So they came to Jericho.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,5);</script>The sons of the
prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do
you know that Yahweh will take away your master from your head today?”
<p>He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,6);</script>Elijah said to him,
“Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.”
<p>He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave
you.” They both went on. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,7);</script>Fifty men of the sons of the
prophets went, and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood
by the Jordan. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,8);</script>Elijah took
his mantle, and wrapped it together, and struck the waters, and they were
divided here and there, so that they two went over on dry ground. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,9);</script>It happened, when they had gone
over, that Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I
am taken from you.”
<p>Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,10);</script>He said, “You have
asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so
for you; but if not, it shall not be so.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,11);</script>It happened, as they
still went on, and talked, that behold, a chariot of fire and horses of
fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(2,12);</script>Elisha saw it, and he
cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
<p>He saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them
in two pieces. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,13);</script>He took up
also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by
the bank of the Jordan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,14);</script>He took the mantle of Elijah that
fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the
God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided
here and there; and Elisha went over. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,15);</script>When the sons of the prophets who
were at Jericho over against him saw him, they said, “The spirit of
Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to
the ground before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,16);</script>They said to him, “See now,
there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek
your master. Perhaps the Spirit of Yahweh has taken him up, and put him on
some mountain, or into some valley.
<p>He said, “You shall not send them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,17);</script>When they urged him
until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.”
<p>They sent therefore fifty men; and they searched for three days, but
didn’t find him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,18);</script>They
came back to him, while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them,
“Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,19);</script>The men of the city
said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant,
as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land miscarries.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,20);</script>He said, “Bring me a
new jar, and put salt in it.” They brought it to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,21);</script>He went out to the spring of the
waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘I have
healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or
miscarrying.’” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,22);</script>So the
waters were healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he
spoke.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(2,23);</script>He went up from there
to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city
and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you
baldhead!” <script type="text/javascript">cb(2,24);</script>He looked
behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of Yahweh. Two female
bears came out of the woods, and mauled forty-two of those youths. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(2,25);</script>He went from there to Mount
Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,1);</script>Now Jehoram the son of
Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of
Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,2);</script>He did that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh, but not like his father, and like his mother; for he put
away the pillar of Baal that his father had made. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,3);</script>Nevertheless he held to the sins
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he
didn’t depart from it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,4);</script>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep
breeder; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred
thousand lambs, and of one hundred thousand rams. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,5);</script>But it happened, when Ahab was
dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,6);</script>King Jehoram went out of Samaria
at that time, and mustered all Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,7);</script>He went and sent to Jehoshaphat
the king of Judah, saying, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me.
Will you go with me against Moab to battle?”
<p>He said, “I will go up. I am as you are, my people as your people, my
horses as your horses.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,8);</script>He said, “Which way shall we go
up?”
<p>He answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,9);</script>So the king of Israel went, and
the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven
days’ journey. There was no water for the army, nor for the animals that
followed them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,10);</script>The king
of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together
to deliver them into the hand of Moab.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,11);</script>But Jehoshaphat said,
“Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh
by him?”
<p>One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of
Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,12);</script>Jehoshaphat said,
“The word of Yahweh is with him.” So the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,13);</script>Elisha said to the
king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your
father, and to the prophets of your mother.”
<p>The king of Israel said to him, “No; for Yahweh has called these
three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,14);</script>Elisha said, “As Yahweh of
Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the
presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you,
nor see you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,15);</script>But now
bring me a minstrel.” It happened, when the minstrel played, that the
hand of Yahweh came on him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,16);</script>He said, “Thus says Yahweh,
‘Make this valley full of trenches.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,17);</script>For thus says Yahweh, ‘You will
not see wind, neither will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled
with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your
animals. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,18);</script>This is but a
light thing in the sight of Yahweh. He will also deliver the Moabites into
your hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,19);</script>You shall
strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every
good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land
with stones.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,20);</script>It happened in the
morning, about the time of offering the offering, that behold, water came
by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,21);</script>Now when all the
Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they
gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and
upward, and stood on the border. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,22);</script>They rose up early in the
morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water
over against them as red as blood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,23);</script>They said, “This is blood. The
kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now
therefore, Moab, to the spoil!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(3,24);</script>When they came to the
camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that
they fled before them; and they went forward into the land smiting the
Moabites. <script type="text/javascript">cb(3,25);</script>They beat down
the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone,
and filled it; and they stopped all the springs of water, and felled all
the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth only they left its stones; however
the men armed with slings went about it, and struck it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(3,26);</script>When the king of Moab saw that
the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who
drew sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(3,27);</script>Then he took his eldest
son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt
offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel: and they
departed from him, and returned to their own land.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,1);</script>Now there cried a
certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying,
“Your servant my husband is dead. You know that your servant feared
Yahweh. Now the creditor has come to take for himself my two children to
be slaves.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,2);</script>Elisha said to her,
“What shall I do for you? Tell me: what do you have in the house?”
<p>She said, “Your handmaid has nothing in the house, except a pot of
oil.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,3);</script>Then he said, “Go,
borrow containers from of all your neighbors, even empty containers.
Don’t borrow just a few. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,4);</script>You shall go in, and shut the door
on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those containers; and you
shall set aside that which is full.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,5);</script>So she went from him,
and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought the containers to
her, and she poured out. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,6);</script>It happened, when the containers
were full, that she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”
<p>He said to her, “There isn’t another container.” The oil stopped
flowing.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,7);</script>Then she came and told
the man of God. He said, “Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt; and you
and your sons live on the rest.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,8);</script>It fell on a day, that
Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a prominent woman; and she
persuaded him to eat bread. So it was, that as often as he passed by, he
turned in there to eat bread. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,9);</script>She said to her husband, “See
now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us
continually. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,10);</script>Please let
us make a little room on the wall. Let us set for him there a bed, a
table, a chair, and a lamp stand. It shall be, when he comes to us, that
he shall turn in there.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,11);</script>One day he came there,
and he turned into the room and lay there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,12);</script>He said to Gehazi his servant,
“Call this Shunammite.” When he had called her, she stood before him.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(4,13);</script>He said to him, “Say
now to her, ‘Behold, you have cared for us with all this care. What is
to be done for you? Would you like to be spoken for to the king, or to the
captain of the army?’”
<p>She answered, “I dwell among my own people.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,14);</script>He said, “What then
is to be done for her?”
<p>Gehazi answered, “Most certainly she has no son, and her husband is
old.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,15);</script>He said, “Call
her.” When he had called her, she stood in the door. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,16);</script>He said, “At this season, when
the time comes around, you will embrace a son.”
<p>She said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your
handmaid.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,17);</script>The woman conceived,
and bore a son at that season, when the time came around, as Elisha had
said to her. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,18);</script>When the
child was grown, it happened one day that he went out to his father to the
reapers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,19);</script>He said to his
father, “My head! My head!”
<p>He said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,20);</script>When he had taken him,
and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then
died. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,21);</script>She went up and
laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went
out. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,22);</script>She called to her
husband, and said, “Please send me one of the servants, and one of the
donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,23);</script>He said, “Why would
you want go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath.”
<p>She said, “It’s alright.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,24);</script>Then she saddled a
donkey, and said to her servant, “Drive, and go forward! Don’t slow
down for me, unless I ask you to.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,25);</script>So she went, and came
to the man of God to Mount Carmel. It happened, when the man of God saw
her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, “Behold, there is the
Shunammite. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,26);</script>Please run
now to meet her, and ask her, ‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your
husband? Is it well with the child?’”
<p>She answered, “It is well.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,27);</script>When she came to the
man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to
thrust her away; but the man of God said, “Leave her alone; for her soul
is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told
me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,28);</script>Then she said, “Did
I desire a son of my lord? Didn’t I say, Do not deceive me?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,29);</script>Then he said to
Gehazi, “Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and
go your way. If you meet any man, don’t greet him; and if anyone greets
you, don’t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the face of the
child.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,30);</script>The mother of the
child said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave
you.”
<p>He arose, and followed her.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,31);</script>Gehazi passed on
before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was
neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told
him, saying, “The child has not awakened.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,32);</script>When Elisha had come
into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,33);</script>He went in therefore, and shut
the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,34);</script>He went up, and lay on the child,
and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on
his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child grew
warm. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,35);</script>Then he returned,
and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched
himself on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened
his eyes. <script type="text/javascript">cb(4,36);</script>He called
Gehazi, and said, “Call this Shunammite!” So he called her.
<p>When she had come in to him, he said, “Take up your son.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,37);</script>Then she went in, and
fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her
son, and went out.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,38);</script>Elisha came again to
Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were
sitting before him; and he said to his servant, “Set on the great pot,
and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,39);</script>One went out into the
field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild
gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of stew; for
they didn’t recognize them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(4,40);</script>So they poured out for the men to
eat. It happened, as they were eating of the stew, that they cried out,
and said, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!” They could not eat
of it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,41);</script>But he said, “Then
bring meal.” He cast it into the pot; and he said, “Pour out for the
people, that they may eat.” There was no harm in the pot.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,42);</script>A man from Baal
Shalishah came, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits,
twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. He said,
“Give to the people, that they may eat.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,43);</script>His servant said,
“What, should I set this before a hundred men?”
<p>But he said, “Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says
Yahweh, ‘They will eat, and will have some left over.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(4,44);</script>So he set it before
them, and they ate, and left some of it, according to the word of Yahweh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,1);</script>Now Naaman, captain of
the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and
honorable, because by him Yahweh had given victory to Syria: he was also a
mighty man of valor, but he was a leper. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,2);</script>The Syrians had gone out in bands,
and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maiden;
and she waited on Naaman’s wife. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,3);</script>She said to her mistress, “I
wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! Then he would
heal him of his leprosy.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,4);</script>Someone went in, and
told his lord, saying, “The maiden who is from the land of Israel said
this.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,5);</script>The king of Syria said,
“Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”
<p>He departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand
pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,6);</script>He brought the letter to the king
of Israel, saying, “Now when this letter has come to you, behold, I have
sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may heal him of his leprosy.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,7);</script>It happened, when the
king of Israel had read the letter, that he tore his clothes, and said,
“Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to heal
a man of his leprosy? But please consider and see how he seeks a quarrel
against me.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,8);</script>It was so, when Elisha
the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, that he
sent to the king, saying, “Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come
now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,9);</script>So Naaman came with his
horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of
Elisha. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,10);</script>Elisha sent a
messenger to him, saying, “Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and
your flesh shall come again to you, and you shall be clean.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,11);</script>But Naaman was angry,
and went away, and said, “Behold, I thought, ‘He will surely come out
to me, and stand, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his
hand over the place, and heal the leper.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,12);</script>Aren’t Abanah and Pharpar, the
rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Couldn’t I
wash in them, and be clean?” So he turned and went away in a rage.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,13);</script>His servants came
near, and spoke to him, and said, “My father, if the prophet had asked
you do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? How much rather
then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,14);</script>Then went he down, and
dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the
man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child,
and he was clean. <script type="text/javascript">cb(5,15);</script>He
returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood
before him; and he said, “See now, I know that there is no God in all
the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, please take a gift from your
servant.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,16);</script>But he said, “As
Yahweh lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none.”
<p>He urged him to take it; but he refused. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,17);</script>Naaman said, “If not, then,
please let two mules’ burden of earth be given to your servant; for your
servant will from now on offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice to
other gods, but to Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,18);</script>In this thing may Yahweh pardon
your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship
there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon.
When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may Yahweh pardon your servant
in this thing.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,19);</script>He said to him, “Go
in peace.”
<p>So he departed from him a little way. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,20);</script>But Gehazi the servant of Elisha
the man of God, said, “Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the
Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As Yahweh
lives, I will run after him, and take something from him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,21);</script>So Gehazi followed
after Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the
chariot to meet him, and said, “Is all well?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,22);</script>He said, “All is
well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, even now two young men of
the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim.
Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,23);</script>Naaman said, “Be
pleased to take two talents.” He urged him, and bound two talents of
silver in two bags, with two changes of clothing, and laid them on two of
his servants; and they carried them before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,24);</script>When he came to the hill, he took
them from their hand, and stored them in the house. Then he let the men
go, and they departed. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,25);</script>But he went in, and stood before
his master. Elisha said to him, “Where did you come from, Gehazi?”
<p>He said, “Your servant went nowhere.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(5,26);</script>He said to him,
“Didn’t my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to
meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and
olive groves and vineyards, and sheep and cattle, and male servants and
female servants? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(5,27);</script>Therefore the leprosy of Naaman
will cling to you and to your seed forever.”
<p>He went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,1);</script>The sons of the
prophets said to Elisha, “See now, the place where we dwell before you
is too small for us. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,2);</script>Please let us go to the Jordan,
and every man take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there,
where we may dwell.”
<p>He answered, “Go!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,3);</script>One said, “Please be
pleased to go with your servants.”
<p>He answered, “I will go.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,4);</script>So he went with them. When they
came to the Jordan, they cut down wood. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,5);</script>But as one was felling a beam, the
axe head fell into the water. Then he cried, and said, “Alas, my master!
For it was borrowed.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,6);</script>The man of God asked,
“Where did it fall?” He showed him the place. He cut down a stick,
threw it in there, and made the iron float. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,7);</script>He said, “Take it.” So he put
out his hand and took it.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,8);</script>Now the king of Syria
was warring against Israel; and he took counsel with his servants, saying,
“My camp will be in such and such a place.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,9);</script>The man of God sent to
the king of Israel, saying, “Beware that you not pass such a place; for
the Syrians are coming down there.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,10);</script>The king of Israel sent to the
place which the man of God told him and warned him of; and he saved
himself there, not once nor twice. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,11);</script>The heart of the king of Syria
was very troubled about this. He called his servants, and said to them,
“Won’t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,12);</script>One of his servants
said, “No, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,
tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,13);</script>He said, “Go and see
where he is, that I may send and get him.”
<p>It was told him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,14);</script>Therefore he sent
horses, chariots, and a great army there. They came by night, and
surrounded the city. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,15);</script>When
the servant of the man of God had risen early, and gone out, behold, an
army with horses and chariots was around the city. His servant said to
him, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,16);</script>He answered,
“Don’t be afraid; for those who are with us are more than those who
are with them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,17);</script>Elisha
prayed, and said, “Yahweh, please open his eyes, that he may see.”
Yahweh opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and behold, the
mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around Elisha. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,18);</script>When they came down to him,
Elisha prayed to Yahweh, and said, “Please strike this people with
blindness.”
<p>He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,19);</script>Elisha said to them, “This is
not the way, neither is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to
the man whom you seek.” He led them to Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,20);</script>It happened, when they had come
into Samaria, that Elisha said, “Yahweh, open the eyes of these men,
that they may see.”
<p>Yahweh opened their eyes, and they saw; and behold, they were in the
midst of Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,21);</script>The
king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, “My father, shall I
strike them? Shall I strike them?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,22);</script>He answered, “You
shall not strike them. Would you strike those whom you have taken captive
with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that
they may eat and drink, and go to their master.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,23);</script>He prepared great
feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they
went to their master. The bands of Syria stopped raiding the land of
Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,24);</script>It happened after
this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and
besieged Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(6,25);</script>There
was a great famine in Samaria. Behold, they besieged it, until a
donkey’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver, and the fourth part
of a kab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,26);</script>As the king of Israel was passing
by on the wall, a woman cried to him, saying, “Help, my lord, O king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,27);</script>He said, “If Yahweh
doesn’t help you, from where could I help you? From of the threshing
floor, or from the winepress?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,28);</script>The king said to her, “What
ails you?”
<p>She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give your son, that we may
eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,29);</script>So we boiled my son, and ate him:
and I said to her on the next day, ‘Give your son, that we may eat
him;’ and she has hidden her son.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,30);</script>It happened, when the
king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes (now he was
passing by on the wall); and the people looked, and behold, he had
sackcloth underneath on his flesh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(6,31);</script>Then he said, “God do so to me,
and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stay on him
this day.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,32);</script>But Elisha was sitting
in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Then the king sent a
man from before him; but before the messenger came to him, he said to the
elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my
head? Behold, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door
shut against him. Isn’t the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(6,33);</script>While he was still
talking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him. Then he said,
“Behold, this evil is from Yahweh. Why should I wait for Yahweh any
longer?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,1);</script>Elisha said, “Hear
the word of Yahweh. Thus says Yahweh, ‘Tomorrow about this time a
measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel, and two measures of
barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,2);</script>Then the captain on
whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, “Behold,
if Yahweh made windows in heaven, could this thing be?”
<p>He said, “Behold, you shall see it with your eyes, but shall not eat
of it.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,3);</script>Now there were four
leprous men at the entrance of the gate. They said one to another, “Why
do we sit here until we die? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,4);</script>If we say, ‘We will enter into
the city,’ then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. If we
sit still here, we also die. Now therefore come, and let us surrender to
the army of the Syrians. If they save us alive, we will live; and if they
kill us, we will only die.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,5);</script>They rose up in the
twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians. When they had come to the
outermost part of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no man there.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,6);</script>For the <a
href="#N3">Lord</a> had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of
chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great army: and they
said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the
kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(7,7);</script>Therefore they arose and
fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their
donkeys, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,8);</script>When these lepers came to the
outermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and ate and drink,
and carried there silver, and gold, and clothing, and went and hid it.
Then they came back, and entered into another tent, and carried there
also, and went and hid it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,9);</script>Then they said one to another,
“We aren’t doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we keep
silent. If we wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us.
Now therefore come, let us go and tell the king’s household.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,10);</script>So they came and
called to the porter of the city; and they told them, saying, “We came
to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither
voice of man, but the horses tied, and the donkeys tied, and the tents as
they were.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,11);</script>He called the porters;
and they told it to the king’s household within. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,12);</script>The king arose in the night, and
said to his servants, “I will now show you what the Syrians have done to
us. They know that we are hungry. Therefore are they gone out of the camp
to hide themselves in the field, saying, ‘When they come out of the
city, we shall take them alive, and get into the city.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,13);</script>One of his servants
answered, “Please let some take five of the horses that remain, which
are left in the city. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel
who are left in it. Behold, they are like all the multitude of Israel who
are consumed. Let us send and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,14);</script>They took therefore
two chariots with horses; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians,
saying, “Go and see.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(7,15);</script>They went after them
to the Jordan; and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels,
which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. The messengers returned,
and told the king. <script type="text/javascript">cb(7,16);</script>The
people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of
fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
according to the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,17);</script>The king appointed the captain on
whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate: and the people trod on
him in the gate, and he died as the man of God had said, who spoke when
the king came down to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,18);</script>It happened, as the man of God
had spoken to the king, saying, “Two measures of barley for a shekel,
and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be tomorrow about this
time in the gate of Samaria”; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,19);</script>and that captain answered the man
of God, and said, “Now, behold, if Yahweh should make windows in heaven,
might such a thing be?” and he said, “Behold, you shall see it with
your eyes, but shall not eat of it.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(7,20);</script>It happened like that to him; for
the people trod on him in the gate, and he died.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,1);</script>Now Elisha had spoken
to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, “Arise, and go,
you and your household, and stay for a while wherever you can; for Yahweh
has called for a famine. It shall also come on the land seven years.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,2);</script>The woman arose, and
did according to the word of the man of God. She went with her household,
and lived in the land of the Philistines seven years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,3);</script>It happened at the seven years’
end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines. Then she
went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,4);</script>Now the king was talking with
Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, “Please tell me all the
great things that Elisha has done.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,5);</script>It happened, as he was telling the
king how he had restored to life him who was dead, that behold, the woman,
whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for
her land. Gehazi said, “My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is
her son, whom Elisha restored to life.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,6);</script>When the king asked the
woman, she told him. So the king appointed to her a certain officer,
saying, “Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field
since the day that she left the land, even until now.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,7);</script>Elisha came to
Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick. It was told him,
saying, “The man of God has come here.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,8);</script>The king said to
Hazael, “Take a present in your hand, and go, meet the man of God, and
inquire of Yahweh by him, saying, ‘Will I recover from this
sickness?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,9);</script>So Hazael went to meet
him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus,
forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, “Your
son Benhadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, ‘Will I recover
from this sickness?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,10);</script>Elisha said to him,
“Go, tell him, ‘You shall surely recover;’ however Yahweh has shown
me that he shall surely die.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,11);</script>He settled his gaze steadfastly
on him, until he was ashamed. Then the man of God wept.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,12);</script>Hazael said, “Why do
you weep, my lord?”
<p>He answered, “Because I know the evil that you will do to the
children of Israel. You will set their strongholds on fire, and you will
kill their young men with the sword, and will dash in pieces their little
ones, and rip up their women with child.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,13);</script>Hazael said, “But
what is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great
thing?”
<p>Elisha answered, “Yahweh has shown me that you will be king over
Syria.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,14);</script>Then he departed from
Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, “What did Elisha say to
you?”
<p>He answered, “He told me that you would surely recover.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,15);</script>It happened on the
next day, that he took a thick cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it on
his face, so that he died. Then Hazael reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,16);</script>In the fifth year of
Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being king of Judah
then, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,17);</script>He was thirty-two years old when
he began to reign. He reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,18);</script>He walked in the way of the kings
of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for he had the daughter of Ahab as
wife. He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,19);</script>However Yahweh would not destroy
Judah, for David his servant’s sake, as he promised him to give to him a
lamp for his children always.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(8,20);</script>In his days Edom
revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(8,21);</script>Then Joram passed over to
Zair, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and struck
the Edomites who surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the
people fled to their tents. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,22);</script>So Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,23);</script>The rest of the acts of Joram,
and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,24);</script>Joram slept with his fathers, and
was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son
reigned in his place. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,25);</script>In
the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah the son
of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,26);</script>Twenty-two years old was Ahaziah
when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His
mother’s name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,27);</script>He walked in the way of the house
of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the
house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(8,28);</script>He went with Joram the son of
Ahab to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth Gilead: and the Syrians
wounded Joram. <script type="text/javascript">cb(8,29);</script>King Joram
returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given
him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Ahaziah the son
of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
Jezreel, because he was sick.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,1);</script>Elisha the prophet
called one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, “Put your belt
on your waist, take this vial of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth
Gilead. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,2);</script>When you come
there, find Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and
make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner room.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,3);</script>Then take the vial of oil,
and pour it on his head, and say, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “I have anointed
you king over Israel.”’ Then open the door, flee, and don’t wait.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,4);</script>So the young man, even
the young man the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,5);</script>When he came, behold, the captains
of the army were sitting. Then he said, “I have a message for you,
captain.”
<p>Jehu said, “To which of us all?”
<p>He said, “To you, O captain.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,6);</script>He arose, and went into the house.
Then he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh,
the God of Israel, ‘I have anointed you king over the people of Yahweh,
even over Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,7);</script>You
shall strike the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of
my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of Yahweh, at
the hand of Jezebel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,8);</script>For
the whole house of Ahab shall perish. I will cut off from Ahab everyone <a
href="#N4">who urinates against a wall,</a> both him who is shut up and
him who is left at large in Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,9);</script>I will make the house of Ahab like
the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the
son of Ahijah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,10);</script>The dogs
will eat Jezebel on the plot of ground of Jezreel, and there shall be none
to bury her.’” He opened the door, and fled.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,11);</script>Then Jehu came forth
to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, “Is all well? Why did
this mad fellow come to you?”
<p>He said to them, “You know the man and what his talk was.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,12);</script>They said, “That is a lie. Tell
us now.”
<p>He said, “He said to me, ‘Thus says Yahweh, I have anointed you
king over Israel.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,13);</script>Then they hurried, and
took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs,
and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,14);</script>So Jehu the son of
Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was
keeping Ramoth Gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(9,15);</script>but king Joram was
returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given
him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) Jehu said, “If this is
your thinking, then let no one escape and go out of the city, to go to
tell it in Jezreel.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,16);</script>So
Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. Ahaziah
king of Judah had come down to see Joram. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,17);</script>Now the watchman was standing on
the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and
said, “I see a company.”
<p>Joram said, “Take a horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say,
‘Is it peace?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,18);</script>So there went one on
horseback to meet him, and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it
peace?’”
<p>Jehu said, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”
<p>The watchman said, “The messenger came to them, but he isn’t coming
back.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,19);</script>Then he sent out a
second on horseback, who came to them, and said, “Thus says the king,
‘Is it peace?’”
<p>Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind
me!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,20);</script>The watchman said,
“He came to them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is like the
driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,21);</script>Joram said, “Get
ready!”
<p>They got his chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of
Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu, and
found him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,22);</script>It happened, when Joram saw Jehu,
that he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”
<p>He answered, “What peace, so long as the prostitution of your mother
Jezebel and her witchcraft abound?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,23);</script>Joram turned his
hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “There is treason, Ahaziah!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,24);</script>Jehu drew his bow with
his full strength, and struck Joram between his arms; and the arrow went
out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,25);</script>Then Jehu said to Bidkar his
captain, “Pick him up, and throw him in the plot of the field of Naboth
the Jezreelite; for remember how, when you and I rode together after Ahab
his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,26);</script>‘Surely I have seen yesterday
the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says Yahweh; ‘and I
will repay you in this plot of ground,’ says Yahweh. Now therefore take
and cast him onto the plot of ground, according to the word of Yahweh.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,27);</script>But when Ahaziah the
king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu
followed after him, and said, “Strike him also in the chariot!” They
struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo,
and died there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,28);</script>His
servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his tomb
with his fathers in the city of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,29);</script>In the eleventh year of Joram the
son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,30);</script>When Jehu had come to Jezreel,
Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and attired her head, and
looked out at the window. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,31);</script>As Jehu entered in at the gate,
she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,32);</script>He lifted up his face
to the window, and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”
<p>Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,33);</script>He said, “Throw her
down!”
<p>So they threw her down; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the
wall, and on the horses. Then he trampled her under foot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(9,34);</script>When he had come in, he ate and
drink; and he said, “See now to this cursed woman, and bury her; for she
is a king’s daughter.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(9,35);</script>They went to bury her;
but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms
of her hands. <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,36);</script>Therefore
they came back, and told him.
<p>He said, “This is the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servant
Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel on
the plot of Jezreel, <script type="text/javascript">cb(9,37);</script>and
the body of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the
portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, “This is
Jezebel.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,1);</script>Now Ahab had seventy
sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of
Jezreel, even the elders, and to those who brought up the sons of Ahab,
saying, <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,2);</script>“Now as soon as
this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you, and
there are with you chariots and horses, a fortified city also, and armor.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,3);</script>Select the best and
fittest of your master’s sons, set him on his father’s throne, and
fight for your master’s house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,4);</script>But they were
exceedingly afraid, and said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand
before him! How then shall we stand?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,5);</script>He who was over the household,
and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who raised the
children, sent to Jehu, saying, “We are your servants, and will do all
that you ask us. We will not make any man king. You do that which is good
in your eyes.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,6);</script>Then he wrote a letter
the second time to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and if you will
listen to my voice, take the heads of the men your master’s sons, and
come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time.”
<p>Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men
of the city, who brought them up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,7);</script>It happened, when the letter came
to them, that they took the king’s sons, and killed them, even seventy
persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,8);</script>A messenger came, and
told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
<p>He said, “Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the
morning.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,9);</script>It happened
in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people,
“You are righteous. Behold, I conspired against my master, and killed
him; but who struck all these? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,10);</script>Know now that nothing shall fall
to the earth of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the
house of Ahab. For Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his servant
Elijah.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,11);</script>So Jehu struck all
that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, with all his great men, his
familiar friends, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,12);</script>He arose and
departed, and went to Samaria. As he was at the shearing house of the
shepherds on the way, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,13);</script>Jehu met with the brothers of
Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, “Who are you?”
<p>They answered, “We are the brothers of Ahaziah. We are going down to
greet the children of the king and the children of the queen.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,14);</script>He said, “Take them
alive!”
<p>They took them alive, and killed them at the pit of the shearing house,
even forty-two men. He didn’t leave any of them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,15);</script>When he had departed from there,
he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him. He greeted him, and
said to him, “Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”
<p>Jehonadab answered, “It is.”
<p>“If it is, give me your hand.” He gave him his hand; and he took
him up to him into the chariot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,16);</script>He said, “Come with me, and
see my zeal for Yahweh.” So they made him ride in his chariot. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,17);</script>When he came to Samaria, he
struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him,
according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,18);</script>Jehu gathered all the people
together, and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will
serve him much. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,19);</script>Now
therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all of his worshippers, and
all of his priests. Let none be absent; for I have a great sacrifice to
Baal. Whoever is absent, he shall not live.” But Jehu did it in
subtlety, intending that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,20);</script>Jehu said,
“Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal!”
<p>They proclaimed it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,21);</script>Jehu sent through all Israel;
and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left
that didn’t come. They came into the house of Baal; and the house of
Baal was filled from one end to another. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,22);</script>He said to him who was over the
vestry, “Bring out robes for all the worshippers of Baal!”
<p>He brought robes out to them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,23);</script>Jehu went with Jehonadab the son
of Rechab into the house of Baal. Then he said to the worshippers of Baal,
“Search, and look that there are here with you none of the servants of
Yahweh, but the worshippers of Baal only.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,24);</script>They went in to offer
sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had appointed him eighty men
outside, and said, “If any of the men whom I bring into your hands
escape, he who lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,25);</script>It happened, as soon
as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to
the guard and to the captains, “Go in, and kill them! Let none
escape.” They struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and
the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(10,26);</script>They brought out the
pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,27);</script>They broke down the pillar of
Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a latrine, to this
day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,28);</script>Thus Jehu destroyed
Baal out of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,29);</script>However from the sins
of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu
didn’t depart from after them, the golden calves that were in Bethel,
and that were in Dan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,30);</script>Yahweh said to Jehu, “Because
you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have
done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons
of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(10,31);</script>But Jehu took no heed
to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He
didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to
sin. <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,32);</script>In those days
Yahweh began to cut off from Israel; and Hazael struck them in all the
borders of Israel; <script type="text/javascript">cb(10,33);</script>from
the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the
Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,34);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, aren’t they written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,35);</script>Jehu slept with his fathers; and
they buried him in Samaria. Jehoahaz his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(10,36);</script>The time that Jehu reigned over
Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,1);</script>Now when Athaliah the
mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all
the seed royal. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,2);</script>But
Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the
son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were
slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid
him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,3);</script>He was with her hidden in the
house of Yahweh six years. Athaliah reigned over the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,4);</script>In the seventh year Jehoiada sent
and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard,
and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh; and he made a covenant
with them, and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh, and showed
them the king’s son. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,5);</script>He
commanded them, saying, “This is the thing that you shall do: a third
part of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of
the king’s house; <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,6);</script>A
third part shall be at the gate Sur; and a third part at the gate behind
the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,7);</script>The two companies of you,
even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of the house of
Yahweh around the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,8);</script>You shall surround the king,
every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks,
let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes
in.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,9);</script>The captains over
hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they
took every man his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with
those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(11,10);</script>The priest delivered to
the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king
David’s, which were in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,11);</script>The guard stood, every man with
his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side
of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,12);</script>Then he brought out the king’s
son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made
him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said,
“Long live the king!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,13);</script>When Athaliah heard
the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the
house of Yahweh: <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,14);</script>and she
looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was,
and the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the
land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and
cried, “Treason! Treason!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(11,15);</script>Jehoiada the priest
commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to
them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill him who follows her with
the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in the
house of Yahweh.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,16);</script>So
they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to
the king’s house. She was slain there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,17);</script>Jehoiada made a covenant between
Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people;
between the king also and the people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,18);</script>All the people of the land went
to the house of Baal, and broke it down; his altars and his images broke
they in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the
altars. The priest appointed officers over the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,19);</script>He took the captains over
hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land;
and they brought down the king from the house of Yahweh, and came by the
way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne
of the kings. <script type="text/javascript">cb(11,20);</script>So all the
people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. Athaliah they had
slain with the sword at the king’s house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(11,21);</script>Jehoash was seven years old when
he began to reign.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,1);</script>In the seventh year of
Jehu began Jehoash to reign; and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem: and
his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,2);</script>Jehoash did that which was right
in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,3);</script>However the high
places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense
in the high places. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,4);</script>Jehoash said to the priests,
“All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of
Yahweh, in current money, the money of the persons for whom each man is
rated, and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring
into the house of Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,5);</script>let the priests take it to them,
every man from his acquaintance; and they shall repair the breaches of the
house, wherever any breach shall be found.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,6);</script>But it was so, that in
the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired
the breaches of the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,7);</script>Then king Jehoash called for
Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why
don’t you repair the breaches of the house? Now therefore take no more
money from your treasurers, but deliver it for the breaches of the
house.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(12,8);</script>The priests consented
that they should take no more money from the people, neither repair the
breaches of the house. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,9);</script>But Jehoiada the priest took a
chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the
right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept
the threshold put therein all the money that was brought into the house of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,10);</script>It was so, when
they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king’s scribe
and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags and counted the money
that was found in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,11);</script>They gave the money that was
weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the
oversight of the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters
and the builders, who worked on the house of Yahweh, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,12);</script>and to the masons and the stone
cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the
house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,13);</script>But there were not made
for the house of Yahweh cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any
vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into
the house of Yahweh; <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,14);</script>for
they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired therewith the house
of Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,15);</script>Moreover they
didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered
the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(12,16);</script>The money for the
trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings, was not brought
into the house of Yahweh: it was the priests’. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,17);</script>Then Hazael king of Syria went
up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up
to Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,18);</script>Jehoash
king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and
Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy
things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of
Yahweh, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
and he went away from Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,19);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(12,20);</script>His servants arose, and made a
conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes
down to Silla. <script type="text/javascript">cb(12,21);</script>For
Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his
servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in
the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,1);</script>In the three and
twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the
son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,2);</script>He did that which was
evil in the sight of Yahweh, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; he didn’t depart from it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,3);</script>The anger of Yahweh was
kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king
of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,4);</script>Jehoahaz begged Yahweh,
and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how that
the king of Syria oppressed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,5);</script>(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so
that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of
Israel lived in their tents as before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,6);</script>Nevertheless they didn’t depart
from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin,
but walked therein: and there remained the Asherah also in Samaria.)
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,7);</script>For he didn’t leave to
Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and
ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them
like the dust in threshing. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,8);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,9);</script>Jehoahaz slept with his fathers;
and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his place.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,10);</script>In the thirty-seventh
year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz began to reign
over Israel in Samaria for sixteen years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,11);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh; he didn’t depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin; but he walked therein.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(13,12);</script>Now the rest of the acts
of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against
Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,13);</script>Joash slept with his fathers;
and Jeroboam sat on his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the
kings of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,14);</script>Now
Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died: and Joash the
king of Israel came down to him, and wept over him, and said, “My
father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,15);</script>Elisha said to him,
“Take bow and arrows”; and he took to him bow and arrows. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,16);</script>He said to the king of Israel,
“Put your hand on the bow”; and he put his hand on it. Elisha laid his
hands on the king’s hands. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,17);</script>He said, “Open the window
eastward”; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot.
He said, “Yahweh’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over
Syria; for you shall strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed
them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,18);</script>He said, “Take the
arrows”; and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the
ground”; and he struck three times, and stopped. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,19);</script>The man of God was angry with
him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would
have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you shall strike
Syria just three times.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(13,20);</script>Elisha died, and they
buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming
in of the year. <script type="text/javascript">cb(13,21);</script>It
happened, as they were burying a man, that behold, they spied a band; and
they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched
the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,22);</script>Hazael king of Syria oppressed
Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,23);</script>But Yahweh was gracious to them,
and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his
covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them,
neither cast he them from his presence as yet. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,24);</script>Hazael king of Syria died; and
Benhadad his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(13,25);</script>Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took
again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he
had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Joash struck him
three times, and recovered the cities of Israel.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,1);</script>In the second year of
Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel began Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah to reign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,2);</script>He was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine
years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,3);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, yet not like David his father: he did
according to all that Joash his father had done. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,4);</script>However the high places were not
taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high
places. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,5);</script>It happened, as
soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, that he killed his
servants who had slain the king his father: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,6);</script>but the children of the murderers
he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book
of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not
be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the
fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,7);</script>He killed of Edom in the Valley
of Salt ten thousand, and took Sela by war, and called its name Joktheel,
to this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,8);</script>Then Amaziah
sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of
Israel, saying, “Come, let us look one another in the face.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(14,9);</script>Jehoash the king of
Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, “The thistle that was in
Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your
daughter to my son as wife. Then a wild animal that was in Lebanon passed
by, and trampled down the thistle. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,10);</script>You have indeed struck Edom, and
your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for
why should you meddle to your harm, that you should fall, even you, and
Judah with you?’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,11);</script>But Amaziah would not listen. So
Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked
one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,12);</script>Judah was defeated by Israel;
and they fled every man to his tent. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,13);</script>Jehoash king of Israel took
Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth
Shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from
the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,14);</script>He took all the gold and silver,
and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the
treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to
Samaria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,15);</script>Now the rest of
the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with
Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,16);</script>Jehoash slept with his fathers,
and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son
reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,17);</script>Amaziah the son of Joash king of
Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
fifteen years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,18);</script>Now the
rest of the acts of Amaziah, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,19);</script>They made a conspiracy against
him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to
Lachish, and killed him there. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,20);</script>They brought him on horses; and
he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,21);</script>All the people of Judah took
Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his
father Amaziah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,22);</script>He built
Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his
fathers. <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,23);</script>In the
fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son
of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria for forty-one years.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(14,24);</script>He did that which was
evil in the sight of Yahweh: he didn’t depart from all the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,25);</script>He restored the border of Israel
from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the
word of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his servant Jonah the
son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath Hepher. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,26);</script>For Yahweh saw the affliction of
Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at
large, neither was there any helper for Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,27);</script>Yahweh didn’t say that he
would blot out the name of Israel from under the sky; but he saved them by
the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(14,28);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he
recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which had belonged to Judah, for Israel,
aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel? <script type="text/javascript">cb(14,29);</script>Jeroboam slept
with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son
reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,1);</script>In the twenty-seventh
year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah
to reign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,2);</script>Sixteen years
old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,3);</script>He did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,4);</script>However the high places
were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the
high places. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,5);</script>Yahweh
struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived
in a separate house. Jotham the king’s son was over the household,
judging the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,6);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Azariah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,7);</script>Azariah slept with his fathers;
and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his
son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,8);</script>In the thirty-eighth year of
Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel
in Samaria six months. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,9);</script>He
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as his fathers had done:
he didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which
he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,10);</script>Shallum the son of Jabesh
conspired against him, and struck him before the people, and killed him,
and reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,11);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Zechariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,12);</script>This
was the word of Yahweh which he spoke to Jehu, saying, “Your sons to the
fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.” So it came to pass.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(15,13);</script>Shallum the son of
Jabesh began to reign in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah;
and he reigned for a month in Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,14);</script>Menahem the son of Gadi went up
from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and struck Shallum the son of Jabesh in
Samaria, and killed him, and reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,15);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,16);</script>Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and
all who were therein, and its borders, from Tirzah: because they didn’t
open to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women therein who were
with child he ripped up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,17);</script>In the nine and thirtieth year
of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over
Israel for ten years in Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,18);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh: he didn’t depart all his days from the sins of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,19);</script>There came against the land Pul
the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver,
that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,20);</script>Menahem exacted the
money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty
shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria
turned back, and didn’t stay there in the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,21);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Menahem, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,22);</script>Menahem slept with his fathers;
and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,23);</script>In the fiftieth year of Azariah
king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in
Samaria for two years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,24);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh: he didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,25);</script>Pekah the son of Remaliah, his
captain, conspired against him, and struck him in Samaria, in the castle
of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh; and with him were fifty men
of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,26);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,27);</script>In the two and fiftieth year of
Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel
in Samaria for twenty years. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,28);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh: he didn’t depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,29);</script>In the days of Pekah king of
Israel came Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abel Beth
Maacah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all
the land of Naphtali; and he carried them captive to Assyria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,30);</script>Hoshea the son of Elah made a
conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and struck him, and killed
him, and reigned in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of
Uzziah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,31);</script>Now the rest of
the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,32);</script>In the second year of Pekah the
son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of
Judah to reign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,33);</script>He was
twenty-five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years
in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,34);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh; he did according to all that his father
Uzziah had done. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,35);</script>However
the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and
burned incense in the high places. He built the upper gate of the house of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(15,36);</script>Now the rest of
the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(15,37);</script>In those days Yahweh began to
send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(15,38);</script>Jotham slept with his
fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father:
and Ahaz his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(16,1);</script>In the seventeenth
year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah
began to reign. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,2);</script>Twenty
years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in
Jerusalem: and he didn’t do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh
his God, like David his father. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,3);</script>But he walked in the way of the
kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according
to the abominations of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the
children of Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,4);</script>He
sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and
under every green tree. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,5);</script>Then Rezin king of Syria and
Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they
besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,6);</script>At that time Rezin king of Syria
recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians
came to Elath, and lived there, to this day. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,7);</script>So Ahaz sent messengers to
Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your
son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of
the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,8);</script>Ahaz took the silver and gold
that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the
king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,9);</script>The king of Assyria listened to
him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and
carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,10);</script>King Ahaz went to Damascus to
meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at
Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the
altar, and its pattern, according to all its workmanship. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,11);</script>Urijah the priest built an
altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah
the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,12);</script>When the king had come from
Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and
offered on it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,13);</script>He burnt
his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering,
and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,14);</script>The bronze altar, which was
before Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between
his altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his
altar. <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,15);</script>King Ahaz
commanded Urijah the priest, saying, “On the great altar burn the
morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king’s
burnt offering, and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the
people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings;
and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood
of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,16);</script>Urijah the priest did
so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,17);</script>King Ahaz cut off the panels of
the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from
off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(16,18);</script>The covered way for the
Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king’s entry outside,
turned he to the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(16,19);</script>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz
which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah? <script type="text/javascript">cb(16,20);</script>Ahaz
slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of
David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,1);</script>In the twelfth year of
Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea the son of Elah began to reign in Samaria over
Israel for nine years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,2);</script>He
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of
Israel who were before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,3);</script>Against him came up Shalmaneser
king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and brought him tribute.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,4);</script>The king of Assyria found
conspiracy in Hoshea; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and
offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year:
therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,5);</script>Then the king of Assyria
came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it
three years. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,6);</script>In the ninth
year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away
to Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,7);</script>It was so, because the children
of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who brought them up out of
the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had
feared other gods, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,8);</script>and
walked in the statutes of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before
the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they made.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,9);</script>The children of Israel
did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God: and they
built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen
to the fortified city; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,10);</script>and they set them up pillars and
Asherim on every high hill, and under every green tree; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,11);</script>and there they burnt incense in
all the high places, as did the nations whom Yahweh carried away before
them; and they worked wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,12);</script>and they served idols, of which
Yahweh had said to them, “You shall not do this thing.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,13);</script>Yet Yahweh testified to Israel,
and to Judah, by every prophet, and every seer, saying, “Turn from your
evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the
law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants
the prophets.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,14);</script>Notwithstanding, they would not
listen, but hardened their neck, like the neck of their fathers, who
didn’t believe in Yahweh their God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,15);</script>They rejected his statutes, and
his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he
testified to them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and followed
the nations that were around them, concerning whom Yahweh had commanded
them that they should not do like them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,16);</script>They forsook all the
commandments of Yahweh their God, and made them molten images, even two
calves, and made an Asherah, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and
served Baal. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,17);</script>They caused
their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used
divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do that which was evil
in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,18);</script>Therefore Yahweh was very angry
with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but
the tribe of Judah only. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,19);</script>Also Judah didn’t keep the
commandments of Yahweh their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel
which they made. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,20);</script>Yahweh
rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them
into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,21);</script>For he tore Israel from
the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and
Jeroboam drove Israel from following Yahweh, and made them sin a great
sin. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,22);</script>The children of
Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they didn’t
depart from them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,23);</script>until
Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight, as he spoke by all his servants
the prophets. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria
to this day. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,24);</script>The king of
Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from
Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of
the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and lived in the
cities of it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,25);</script>So it was,
at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they didn’t fear Yahweh:
therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,26);</script>Therefore they spoke to the king
of Assyria, saying, “The nations which you have carried away, and placed
in the cities of Samaria, don’t know the law of the god of the land.
Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they kill them,
because they don’t know the law of the god of the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,27);</script>Then the king of
Assyria commanded, saying, “Carry there one of the priests whom you
brought from there; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach
them the law of the god of the land.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(17,28);</script>So one of the priests
whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel, and
taught them how they should fear Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,29);</script>However every nation made gods
of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the
Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities in which they lived.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,30);</script>The men of Babylon made
Succoth Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath
made Ashima, <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,31);</script>and the
Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burnt their children
in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,32);</script>So they feared Yahweh, and made
to them from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed
for them in the houses of the high places. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,33);</script>They feared Yahweh, and served
their own gods, after the ways of the nations from among whom they had
been carried away. <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,34);</script>To
this day they do what they did before: they don’t fear Yahweh, neither
do they follow their statutes, or their ordinances, or the law or the
commandment which Yahweh commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named
Israel; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,35);</script>with whom Yahweh
had made a covenant, and commanded them, saying, “You shall not fear
other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to
them; <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,36);</script>but you shall fear
Yahweh, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and
with an outstretched arm, and you shall bow yourselves to him, and you
shall sacrifice to him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,37);</script>The statutes and the ordinances,
and the law and the commandment, which he wrote for you, you shall observe
to do forevermore. You shall not fear other gods. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,38);</script>You shall not forget the
covenant that I have made with you; neither shall you fear other gods.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(17,39);</script>But you shall fear
Yahweh your God; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your
enemies.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(17,40);</script>However they
did not listen, but they did what they did before. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(17,41);</script>So these nations feared Yahweh,
and served their engraved images. Their children likewise, and their
children’s children, as their fathers did, so they do to this day.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,1);</script>Now it happened in the
third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of
Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,2);</script>He was twenty-five years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his
mother’s name was Abi the daughter of Zechariah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,3);</script>He did that which was right in
the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,4);</script>He removed the high
places, and broke the pillars, and cut down the Asherah: and he broke in
pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made; for in those days the
children of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,5);</script>He trusted in Yahweh, the
God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of
Judah, nor among them that were before him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,6);</script>For he joined with Yahweh; he
didn’t depart from following him, but kept his commandments, which
Yahweh commanded Moses. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,7);</script>Yahweh was with him; wherever he
went forth he prospered: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
didn’t serve him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,8);</script>He
struck the Philistines to Gaza and its borders, from the tower of the
watchmen to the fortified city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,9);</script>It happened in the fourth year of
king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of
Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
besieged it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,10);</script>At the end
of three years they took it: in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the
ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,11);</script>The king of Assyria carried
Israel away to Assyria, and put them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river
of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,12);</script>because they didn’t obey the
voice of Yahweh their God, but transgressed his covenant, even all that
Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded, and would not hear it, nor do it.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,13);</script>Now in the fourteenth
year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
fortified cities of Judah, and took them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,14);</script>Hezekiah king of Judah sent to
the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, “I have offended; return from
me. That which you put on me, I will bear.” The king of Assyria
appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and
thirty talents of gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,15);</script>Hezekiah gave him all the silver
that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the
king’s house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,16);</script>At that
time, Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of Yahweh’s temple, and
from the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to
the king of Assyria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,17);</script>The
king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to
king Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. They went up and came to
Jerusalem. When they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of
the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller’s field. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,18);</script>When they had called to the
king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the
household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,19);</script>Rabshakeh said to them,
“Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria,
“What confidence is this in which you trust? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,20);</script>You say (but they are but vain
words), ‘There is counsel and strength for war.’ Now on whom do you
trust, that you have rebelled against me? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,21);</script>Now, behold, you trust in the
staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt. If a man leans on it, it will
go into his hand, and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who
trust on him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,22);</script>But if you
tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God;’ isn’t that he whose high
places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and
to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?’
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,23);</script>Now therefore, please
give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two
thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,24);</script>How then can you turn
away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and
put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,25);</script>Have I now come up without
Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, ‘Go up
against this land, and destroy it.’”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,26);</script>Then Eliakim the son
of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to
your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it. Don’t speak
with us in the Jews’ language, in the hearing of the people who are on
the wall.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,27);</script>But Rabshakeh said to
them, “Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these
words? Hasn’t he sent me to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their
own dung, and to drink their own water with you?” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,28);</script>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried
with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and spoke, saying, “Hear the
word of the great king, the king of Assyria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,29);</script>Thus says the king, ‘Don’t
let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you out of
his hand. <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,30);</script>Neither let
Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver
us, and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of
Assyria.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,31);</script>Don’t
listen to Hezekiah.’ For thus says the king of Assyria, ‘Make your
peace with me, and come out to me; and everyone of you eat of his vine,
and everyone of his fig tree, and everyone drink the waters of his own
cistern; <script type="text/javascript">cb(18,32);</script>until I come
and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new
wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and of honey,
that you may live, and not die. Don’t listen to Hezekiah, when he
persuades you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,33);</script>Has any of the gods of the
nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
<script type="text/javascript">cb(18,34);</script>Where are the gods of
Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and
Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,35);</script>Who are they among all the gods
of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that
Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(18,36);</script>But the people held
their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment
was, “Don’t answer him.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(18,37);</script>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
who was over the household, came with Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son
of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him
the words of Rabshakeh.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,1);</script>It happened, when king
Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, and covered himself with
sackcloth, and went into the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,2);</script>He sent Eliakim, who was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered
with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,3);</script>They said to him, “Thus says
Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of trouble, of rebuke, and of rejection;
for the children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength
to deliver them. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,4);</script>It may
be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of
Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the
words which Yahweh your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for
the remnant that is left.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,5);</script>So the servants of
king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,6);</script>Isaiah said to them, “Thus you
shall tell your master, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Don’t be afraid of the
words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
have blasphemed me. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,7);</script>Behold, I will put a spirit in
him, and he will hear news, and will return to his own land. I will cause
him to fall by the sword in his own land.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,8);</script>So Rabshakeh returned,
and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard
that he had departed from Lachish. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,9);</script>When he heard it said of Tirhakah
king of Ethiopia, “Behold, he has come out to fight against you, he sent
messengers again to Hezekiah, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,10);</script>‘Thus you shall speak to
Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, “Don’t let your God in whom you trust
deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king
of Assyria. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,11);</script>Behold, you
have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying
them utterly. Will you be delivered? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,12);</script>Have the gods of the nations
delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and
Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Telassar? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,13);</script>Where is the king of Hamath, and
the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and
Ivvah?”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,14);</script>Hezekiah received the
letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it. Then Hezekiah went up
to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,15);</script>Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh,
and said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sit above the cherubim, you
are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have
made heaven and earth. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,16);</script>Incline your ear, Yahweh, and
hear. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, with
which he has sent to defy the living God. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,17);</script>Truly, Yahweh, the kings of
Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,18);</script>and have cast their gods into
the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and
stone. Therefore they have destroyed them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,19);</script>Now therefore, Yahweh our God,
save us, I beg you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth
may know that you, Yahweh, are God alone.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,20);</script>Then Isaiah the son
of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,
‘Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I
have heard you. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,21);</script>This is
the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: “The virgin daughter of
Zion has despised you and ridiculed you. The daughter of Jerusalem has
shaken her head at you. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,22);</script>Whom have you defied and
blasphemed? Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your
eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,23);</script>By your messengers you have
defied the Lord, and have said, ‘With the multitude of my chariots, I
have come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of
Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees;
and I will enter into his farthest lodging place, the forest of his
fruitful field. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,24);</script>I have
dug and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet will I dry up
all the rivers of Egypt.’ <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,25);</script>Haven’t you heard how I have
done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now have I brought it to
pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous
heaps. <script type="text/javascript">cb(19,26);</script>Therefore their
inhabitants were of small power. They were dismayed and confounded. They
were like the grass of the field, and like the green herb, like the grass
on the housetops, and like grain blasted before it has grown up. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,27);</script>But I know your sitting down,
and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,28);</script>Because of your raging
against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore
will I put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will
turn you back by the way by which you came.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,29);</script>“‘This shall be
the sign to you: You shall eat this year that which grows of itself, and
in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year
sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat its fruit. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,30);</script>The remnant that has escaped of
the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,31);</script>For out of Jerusalem a
remnant will go out, and out of Mount Zion those who shall escape. The
zeal of Yahweh will perform this.’
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,32);</script>“Therefore thus
says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, ‘He shall not come to this
city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither shall he come before it with
shield, nor cast up a mound against it. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,33);</script>By the way that he came, by the
same shall he return, and he shall not come to this city,’ says Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(19,34);</script>‘For I will defend
this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my servant David’s
sake.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(19,35);</script>It happened that
night, that the angel of Yahweh went out, and struck one hundred
eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians. When men arose early in
the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,36);</script>So Sennacherib king of Assyria
departed, and went and returned, and lived at Nineveh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(19,37);</script>It happened, as he was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer
struck him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Esar
Haddon his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,1);</script>In those days was
Hezekiah sick to death. Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him,
and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Set your house in order; for you
shall die, and not live.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,2);</script>Then he turned his
face to the wall, and prayed to Yahweh, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,3);</script>“Remember now, Yahweh, I beg
you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and
have done that which is good in your sight.” Hezekiah wept bitterly.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,4);</script>It happened, before
Isaiah had gone out into the middle part of the city, that the word of
Yahweh came to him, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,5);</script>“Turn back, and tell Hezekiah
the prince of my people, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your
father, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I
will heal you. On the third day, you shall go up to the house of Yahweh.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(20,6);</script>I will add to your days
fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the
king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my
servant David’s sake.”’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,7);</script>Isaiah said, “Take a
cake of figs.”
<p>They took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,8);</script>Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What
shall be the sign that Yahweh will heal me, and that I shall go up to the
house of Yahweh the third day?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,9);</script>Isaiah said, “This
shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing that
he has spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten
steps?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,10);</script>Hezekiah answered,
“It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Nay, but
let the shadow return backward ten steps.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,11);</script>Isaiah the prophet
cried to Yahweh; and he brought the shadow ten steps backward, by which it
had gone down on the dial of Ahaz.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,12);</script>At that time Berodach
Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to
Hezekiah; for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,13);</script>Hezekiah listened to them, and
showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the
gold, and the spices, and the precious oil, and the house of his armor,
and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house,
nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,14);</script>Then Isaiah the prophet came to
king Hezekiah, and said to him, “What did these men say? From where did
they come to you?”
<p>Hezekiah said, “They have come from a far country, even from
Babylon.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,15);</script>He said, “What have
they seen in your house?”
<p>Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is
nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,16);</script>Isaiah said to
Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,17);</script>‘Behold, the days come, that
all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have laid up in
store to this day, shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left,’
says Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(20,18);</script>‘Of your
sons who shall issue from you, whom you shall father, shall they take
away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,19);</script>Then Hezekiah said to
Isaiah, “The word of Yahweh which you have spoken is good.” He said
moreover, “Isn’t it so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(20,20);</script>Now the rest of the
acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made the pool, and the
conduit, and brought water into the city, aren’t they written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(20,21);</script>Hezekiah slept with his fathers;
and Manasseh his son reigned in his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,1);</script>Manasseh was twelve
years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-five years in
Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hephzibah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,2);</script>He did that which was evil in the
sight of Yahweh, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast
out before the children of Israel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,3);</script>For he built again the high
places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars
for Baal, and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped
all the army of the sky, and served them. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,4);</script>He built altars in the house of
Yahweh, of which Yahweh said, “I will put my name in Jerusalem.”
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,5);</script>He built altars for all
the army of the sky in the two courts of the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,6);</script>He made his son to pass through
the fire, and practiced sorcery, and used enchantments, and dealt with
those who had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he worked much evil in
the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,7);</script>He set the engraved image of
Asherah, that he had made, in the house of which Yahweh said to David and
to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name forever;
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,8);</script>neither will I cause the
feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their
fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have
commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses
commanded them.” <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,9);</script>But
they didn’t listen: and Manasseh seduced them to do that which is evil
more than the nations did whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of
Israel. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,10);</script>Yahweh spoke by
his servants the prophets, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,11);</script>“Because Manasseh king of
Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that
the Amorites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with
his idols; <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,12);</script>therefore
thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Behold, I bring such evil on
Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,13);</script>I will stretch over
Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I
will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside
down. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,14);</script>I will cast off
the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their
enemies. They will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,15);</script>because they have done that
which is evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day
their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(21,16);</script>Moreover Manasseh
shed innocent blood very much, until he had filled Jerusalem from one end
to another; besides his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that
which was evil in the sight of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,17);</script>Now the rest of the acts of
Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, aren’t they
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,18);</script>Manasseh slept with his fathers,
and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and
Amon his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,19);</script>Amon was twenty-two years old
when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem: and his
mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,20);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, as Manasseh his father did. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,21);</script>He walked in all the way that
his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and
worshiped them: <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,22);</script>and he
forsook Yahweh, the God of his fathers, and didn’t walk in the way of
Yahweh. <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,23);</script>The servants of
Amon conspired against him, and put the king to death in his own house.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(21,24);</script>But the people of the
land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people
of the land made Josiah his son king in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(21,25);</script>Now the rest of the acts of Amon
which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Judah? <script type="text/javascript">cb(21,26);</script>He was
buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in
his place.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,1);</script>Josiah was eight years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem:
and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,2);</script>He did that which was
right in the eyes of Yahweh, and walked in all the way of David his
father, and didn’t turn aside to the right hand or to the left. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,3);</script>It happened in the eighteenth
year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the
son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of Yahweh, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,4);</script>“Go up to Hilkiah the high
priest, that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of
Yahweh, which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,5);</script>Let them deliver it into
the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh; and
let them give it to the workmen who are in the house of Yahweh, to repair
the breaches of the house, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,6);</script>to the carpenters, and to the
builders, and to the masons, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair
the house. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,7);</script>However there
was no accounting made with them of the money that was delivered into
their hand; for they dealt faithfully.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,8);</script>Hilkiah the high
priest said to Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in
the house of Yahweh.” Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read
it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(22,9);</script>Shaphan the scribe
came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, “Your
servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have
delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the
house of Yahweh.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,10);</script>Shaphan the scribe told the
king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me.” Shaphan
read it before the king. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,11);</script>It happened, when the king had
heard the words of the book of the law, that he tore his clothes. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,12);</script>The king commanded Hilkiah the
priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and
Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,13);</script>“Go inquire of Yahweh for me,
and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book
that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against
us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do
according to all that which is written concerning us.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(22,14);</script>So Hilkiah the
priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah
the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas,
keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter);
and they talked with her. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,15);</script>She said to them, “Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,16);</script>“Thus says Yahweh, ‘Behold,
I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the
words of the book which the king of Judah has read. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,17);</script>Because they have forsaken me,
and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger
with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath shall be kindled
against this place, and it shall not be quenched.’” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,18);</script>But to the king of Judah, who
sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus you shall tell him, “Thus says
Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Concerning the words which you have heard,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(22,19);</script>because your heart was
tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I
spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should
become a desolation and a curse, and have torn your clothes, and wept
before me; I also have heard you,’ says Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(22,20);</script>‘Therefore behold, I will
gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in
peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this
place.’”’” They brought back this message to the king.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,1);</script>The king sent, and
they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,2);</script>The king went up to the house of
Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with
him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and
great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant
which was found in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,3);</script>The king stood by the pillar, and
made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his
commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart,
and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written
in this book: and all the people stood to the covenant. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,4);</script>The king commanded Hilkiah the
high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the
threshold, to bring forth out of Yahweh’s temple all the vessels that
were made for Baal, and for the Asherah, and for all the army of the sky,
and he burned them outside of Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron, and
carried their ashes to Bethel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,5);</script>He put down the idolatrous
priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high
places in the cities of Judah, and in the places around Jerusalem; those
also who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the
planets, and to all the army of the sky. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,6);</script>He brought out the Asherah from
the house of Yahweh, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned
it at the brook Kidron, and beat it to dust, and cast its dust on the
graves of the common people. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,7);</script>He broke down the houses of the
sodomites, that were in the house of Yahweh, where the women wove hangings
for the Asherah. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,8);</script>He
brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high
places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; and
he broke down the high places of the gates that were at the entrance of
the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left
hand at the gate of the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,9);</script>Nevertheless the priests of the
high places didn’t come up to the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, but they
ate unleavened bread among their brothers. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,10);</script>He defiled Topheth, which is in
the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or
his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,11);</script>He took away the horses that the
kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of
Yahweh, by the room of Nathan Melech the officer, who was in the court;
and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,12);</script>The king broke down the altars
that were on the roof of the upper room of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah
had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the
house of Yahweh, and beat them down from there, and cast their dust into
the brook Kidron. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,13);</script>The
the king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
the right hand of the mountain of corruption, which Solomon the king of
Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and for
Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the
children of Ammon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,14);</script>He
broke in pieces the pillars, and cut down the Asherim, and filled their
places with the bones of men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,15);</script>Moreover the altar that was at
Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to sin, had made, even that altar and the high place he broke down;
and he burned the high place and beat it to dust, and burned the Asherah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,16);</script>As Josiah turned
himself, he spied the tombs that were there in the mountain; and he sent,
and took the bones out of the tombs, and burned them on the altar, and
defiled it, according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God
proclaimed, who proclaimed these things. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,17);</script>Then he said, “What monument
is that which I see?”
<p>The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God, who
came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that you have done against
the altar of Bethel.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,18);</script>He said, “Let him
be! Let no man move his bones.” So they let his bones alone, with the
bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,19);</script>All the houses also of the high
places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had
made to provoke Yahweh to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,20);</script>He killed all the priests of the
high places that were there, on the altars, and burned men’s bones on
them; and he returned to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,21);</script>The king commanded all the
people, saying, “Keep the Passover to Yahweh your God, as it is written
in this book of the covenant.” <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,22);</script>Surely there was not kept such a
Passover from the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the
days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,23);</script>but in the eighteenth year of
king Josiah was this Passover kept to Yahweh in Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,24);</script>Moreover Josiah removed those
who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the teraphim, and the
idols, and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in
Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written
in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of Yahweh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,25);</script>Like him was there no king
before him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, and with all his
soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
after him arose there any like him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,26);</script>Notwithstanding, Yahweh didn’t
turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, with which his anger was
kindled against Judah, because of all the provocation with which Manasseh
had provoked him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,27);</script>Yahweh
said, “I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed
Israel, and I will cast off this city which I have chosen, even Jerusalem,
and the house of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(23,28);</script>Now the rest of the
acts of Josiah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,29);</script>In his days Pharaoh Necoh king
of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and
king Josiah went against him; and Pharaoh Necoh killed him at Megiddo,
when he had seen him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,30);</script>His servants carried him in a
chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in
his own tomb. The people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and
anointed him, and made him king in his father’s place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,31);</script>Jehoahaz was twenty-three years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: and
his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,32);</script>He did that which was
evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(23,33);</script>Pharaoh Necoh put him in
bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in
Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver,
and a talent of gold. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,34);</script>Pharaoh Necoh made Eliakim the
son of Josiah king in the place of Josiah his father, and changed his name
to Jehoiakim: but he took Jehoahaz away; and he came to Egypt, and died
there. <script type="text/javascript">cb(23,35);</script>Jehoiakim gave
the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the
money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and
the gold of the people of the land, of everyone according to his taxation,
to give it to Pharaoh Necoh. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,36);</script>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and
his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(23,37);</script>He did that which was evil in
the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his fathers had done.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(24,1);</script>In his days
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant
three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,2);</script>Yahweh sent against him bands of
the Chaldeans, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and
bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his servants the
prophets. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,3);</script>Surely at the
commandment of Yahweh came this on Judah, to remove them out of his sight,
for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did, <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,4);</script>and also for the innocent blood
that he shed; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood: and Yahweh
would not pardon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,5);</script>Now the
rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, aren’t they written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,6);</script>So Jehoiakim slept with his
fathers; and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,7);</script>The king of Egypt didn’t come
again out of his land any more; for the king of Babylon had taken, from
the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates, all that pertained to the king
of Egypt. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,8);</script>Jehoiachin was
eighteen years old when he began to reign; and he reigned in Jerusalem
three months: and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of
Elnathan of Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,9);</script>He
did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that his
father had done. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,10);</script>At that
time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem,
and the city was besieged. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,11);</script>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came to the city, while his servants were besieging it; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,12);</script>and Jehoiachin the king of Judah
went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and
his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the
eighth year of his reign. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,13);</script>He carried out there all the
treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king’s house,
and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel
had made in Yahweh’s temple, as Yahweh had said. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,14);</script>He carried away all Jerusalem,
and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valor, even ten thousand
captives, and all the craftsmen and the smiths; none remained, except the
poorest sort of the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,15);</script>He carried away Jehoiachin to
Babylon; and the king’s mother, and the king’s wives, and his
officers, and the chief men of the land, carried he into captivity from
Jerusalem to Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,16);</script>All the men of might, even seven
thousand, and the craftsmen and the smiths one thousand, all of them
strong and apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to
Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(24,17);</script>The king of
Babylon made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s father’s brother, king is his
place, and changed his name to Zedekiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(24,18);</script>Zedekiah was twenty-one years
old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and
his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,19);</script>He did that which was
evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(24,20);</script>For through the anger of
Yahweh, it happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out
from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,1);</script>It happened in the
ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the
month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army,
against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against
it around it. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,2);</script>So the city
was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,3);</script>On the ninth day of the fourth
month the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for
the people of the land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,4);</script>Then a breach was made in the
city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between
the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were
against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,5);</script>But the army of the
Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of
Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,6);</script>Then they took the king, and
carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on
him. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,7);</script>They killed the sons
of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound
him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,8);</script>Now in the fifth month, on the
seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,9);</script>He burnt the house of Yahweh, and
the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great
house, burnt he with fire. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,10);</script>All the army of the Chaldeans,
who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around
Jerusalem. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,11);</script>Nebuzaradan
the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people
who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king
of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,12);</script>But the captain of the guard
left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,13);</script>The Chaldeans broke up
the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and
the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, and carried the brass
pieces to Babylon. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,14);</script>They
took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the
vessels of brass with which they ministered. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,15);</script>The captain of the guard took
away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that
which was of silver, in silver. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,16);</script>The two pillars, the one sea,
and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, the brass
of all these vessels was without weight. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,17);</script>The height of the one pillar was
eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it; and the height of the
capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital
around it, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with
network. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,18);</script>The captain of
the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest,
and the three keepers of the threshold: <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,19);</script>and out of the city he took an
officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the
king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of
the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people
of the land, who were found in the city. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,20);</script>Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,21);</script>The king of Babylon
struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So
Judah was carried away captive out of his land. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,22);</script>As for the people who were left
in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even
over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan,
governor. <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,23);</script>Now when all
the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of
Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah
the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the
Maacathite, they and their men. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,24);</script>Gedaliah swore to them and to
their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants
of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it
shall be well with you.”
<p><script type="text/javascript">cb(25,25);</script>But it happened in
the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama,
of the royal seed came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that
he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,26);</script>All the people, both
small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt;
for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,27);</script>It happened in the seven and
thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the
twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that
Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted
up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; <script
type="text/javascript">cb(25,28);</script>and he spoke kindly to him, and
set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,
<script type="text/javascript">cb(25,29);</script>and changed his prison
garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his
life: <script type="text/javascript">cb(25,30);</script>and for his
allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every
day a portion, all the days of his life.
